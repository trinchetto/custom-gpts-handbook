# ü§ñ‚ú® OpenAI Custom GPTs Handbook ‚ú®ü§ñ

## Overview
- **Purpose:** This repository is a concise handbook for building and maintaining OpenAI Custom GPTs. It focuses on combining system instructions, personas, retrieval sources, and benchmarking strategies to create reliable assistants tailored to specific roles.
- **Structure:** The full handbook and benchmarking reference live in the [docs](docs/) directory: see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed guidance and [Benchmark Design Consideration](docs/benchmark-design-consideration.pdf) for evaluation frameworks.

## Key Concepts
- **Technique Summary:** The handbook surveys essential practices‚Äîprogramming a GPT with system instructions, adding custom instructions, applying retrieval‚Äëaugmented generation (RAG), integrating personas, equipping GPTs with tools, and more.
- **Benchmarking Guidance:** Detailed steps outline how to design test prompts, build evaluation rubrics, and iterate on GPT configurations using the included ‚ÄúBenchmark Design Consideration‚Äù PDF.

## Next Steps
- **Deepen Expertise:** Explore the resources in the ‚ÄúContinuous Learning & Staying Connected‚Äù section (e.g., Prompt Engineering Paper, OpenAI Custom GPTs course) to stay current with best practices and evolving techniques.
- **Hands-On Practice:** Try building a persona-driven GPT, attach retrieval documents for domain knowledge, and establish your own benchmark set to measure improvements over time.

With these foundations, newcomers can confidently begin experimenting with Custom GPTs, iteratively refining them through careful instruction design, retrieval strategies, and systematic testing.
